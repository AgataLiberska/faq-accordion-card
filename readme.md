# Frontend Mentor - FAQ Accordion Card

![Design preview for the Profile card component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Goal

The Goal of this challenge was to recreate the above design as closely as possible, using any tools.

My personal goal for this challenge was to practise SCSS, as well as BEM methodology.

You can find the final result [under this link](https://faq-accordion-card-eight-omega.vercel.app/)

## Approach and Technologies Used

* HTML 5
* SCCS (following BEM methodology)
* Vanilla JS

For the stylised scrollbar, I used [SimpleBar](https://github.com/Grsmto/simplebar/tree/master/packages/simplebar)

Design-wise, I started working from the mobile design, building up to desktop.

## Lessons learnt

This was my first personal project in which I used an external package - which defnitely made me appreciate a thorough README!

Thanks to the feedback from mentors and my own research, I learnt a lot about making design accessible to all web users. This is definitely a topic I want to explore and will practise more in future projects.
